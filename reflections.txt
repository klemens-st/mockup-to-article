You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I have learned how to indent my code better and make it more readable.
It has also been useful to learn how to use the figure element properly.

Translating the mockup was easy in general as I have some experience with HTML.
I have not found anything challenging so far in this course.

To overcome challenges I used the MDN to make sure I am using proper elements.
For instance, to make a strikethrough I looked up all the elements that could achieve it
and then chose the most appropriate one for my task.
